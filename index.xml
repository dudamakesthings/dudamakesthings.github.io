        <description>This is my project for my Yogini Path and a healthy life I really like yoga, my first contact was with the postures(asanas) that I started in 2018 at a free class in the university that I used to do.
It was really nice and I really loved the experience. Next, I used sometimes YouTube videos from Pri Leite and Yoga Mudra, two Brazilian channels but never did so often. I started to read more about yoga.</description>

      <title>Electric Sheep Crafts</title>

        <description>Electric Sheep Crafts is a brand created in February 2023 for showing to the world my work and selling it, but it represents more than just money for me.
Sadly since I made it 1 year ago it is still an empty page.
Basically is a Instagram page, click here to see it and a logo that I created and execute myself.
The name was inspired in the book of Philip K.</description>

        <description>Hello and Welcome!
My name is Eduarda but you can call me Duda.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Brazilian woman in the 30&amp;rsquo;s living in the Netherlands.
I love to do handmade things, like crochet and knitting.
In this space, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to post some projects, write about my opinion about books, and movies and write about my learning experiences.
Why Duda Makes Things? Well, because I have a lot of hobbies and I love to learn, so, I have done and I do so many different things.</description>
